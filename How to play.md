## How to play
* The game is played against a computer that makes random marks.
* The game starts by choosing the size for the NxN game board.
* The number you enter will be the number both columns and rows.
* Who will start the game and the mark to be taken are random.
* When it's your turn, you should look at the game board and put your mark.
* To put your mark, you must enter the row after column number before the numbers on the game board.
  There must be a number within this playing field. Otherwise you have to re-enter.
* **The goal is to make SOS.
  One point is earned for each SOS.
  If you make SOS, it's your turn again.
  The game is over when there are no empty cells on the game board.
  Whoever makes the most SOS wins.**
